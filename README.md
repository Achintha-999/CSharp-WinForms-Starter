## About
This project is aimed at complete beginners. The main goal is to show how to:
- Create a Windows Forms UI
- Wire up button click events
- Update UI elements (for example, change a Label's text)
- Build and run the app in Visual Studio

</p>

Notes:
- Make sure `image1.png` is present at the repository root. If your image is inside a different folder, update the path accordingly (for example `./docs/image1.png`).
- If the image doesn't display on GitHub, check that the file was committed and the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive on some systems).

## Features
- Beginner-friendly, minimal code.
- Example of event handling: button click → label update.
- Simple WinForms layout that is easy to extend.

}
```
